            <li><h3>Abyssinian</h3></li>
            <img src="htmimgs/abyssinian.jpg"></img>
            <p>Abyssinians aren’t for those who want a cat that enjoys being picked up and cuddled. Because they can often be courageous, curious, and high-spirited, when they feel restrained Abyssinians tend to attempt to struggle free.

                That’s not to say Abyssinians are aloof or standoffish; they’re typically affectionate, devoted, and loving companions. While typically not lap cats, they may prefer to sit next to you rather than on you. Nevertheless, they’ll follow you from room to room to keep an eye on what you’re doing.
                
                While Abyssinians will cheerfully entertain themselves, they are most happy when they’re very involved member of the household. They are particularly involved at dinnertime. Abyssinians regularly perform antics for your-and their-amusement, earning them the reputation of the clowns of the cat kingdom. They may perch on shoulders, crawl under covers, and sit beside you purring madly before racing off to bat imaginary butterflies and make flying leaps at the tallest bookcases.
                
                Natural athletes, no closed room or cupboard is safe from their agile paws and inquiring minds. Vocally they tend to be quiet. They purr with great enthusiasm, however, particularly around dinner time. If you’ll be away all day, you may want to consider providing a cat companion to keep your Abyssinians entertained or she will become bored and may act out.  If you work all day and have an active social life at night, an Abyssinian may not be the cat for you. </p>

                <li><h3>American Bobtail</h3></li>
                <img src="htmimgs/american-bobtail.jpg"></img>
                <p>The American Bobtail has a wild look but not a wild temperament. This breed’s devoted, loving, and intelligent personality has earned them a loyal following. These confident, friendly cats bond emotionally with their families and are devoted companions that adapt quickly to most home environments.

                    Not as vocal as breeds like the Siamese, Bobtails nevertheless are not shy about making their feelings known. Bobtails are playful, energetic, and friendly, and possess an uncanny intelligence for Houdini-type escapes from closed rooms and fastened doors. Very people-oriented, they may solicit attention from their family by meowing or commandeering available laps.
                    
                    On the cat activity scale, the Bobtail is fun-loving and frisky but not overactive. American Bobtails usually get along well with other cats and cat-friendly dogs if properly introduced. Instead of hiding under the bed, they are curious and outgoing when unfamiliar visitors come to call. If trained from an early age, they tend to be good travelers.</p>

                    <li><h3>American Curl</h3></li>
                    <img src="htmimgs/american-curl.jpg"></img>
                    <p>American Curls have qualities other than the whimsical ears that make them attractive pets. They are people cats who are rarely aloof and are affectionate without harassing their families for attention. They enjoy perching on laps and love to pat and nuzzle their family members. American Curls are oftentimes easily taught to play fetch and rarely lose their love of play. They often do very well with children. While not as active as the Abyssinian or Siamese, American Curls are plenty frisky and energetic. They also display the typical cat curiosity and want to be right there to investigate any changes in their home.</p>

                    <li><h3>American Shorthair</h3></li>
                    <img src="htmimgs/american-shorthair.jpg"></img>
                    <p>When describing the American Shorthair, the expression “happy medium” springs to mind. These all-American cats are medium in size, build, type, and temperament; they are neither too big nor too small, not overly cuddly nor distant, neither couch potatoes nor hyperactive. The American Shorthair is the perfect breed for those who want a cat that enjoys being in your lap but not in your face. American Shorthairs are known for their adaptable temperaments and quiet voices; they are sociable, easily trained, and adapt well to other animals and children. They generally do not like to be picked up; like their Pilgrim companions who left England to find freedom, they cherish their independence. Because of the American Shorthair’s history as a working cat, they make great companions in terms of health, strength, and vitality. American Shorthairs enjoy a good romp with their favorite humans, but can amuse themselves with a ball of paper just as well. They tend to remain active and playful well into their old age. Due to their barn cat background, ASHs have strong hunting instincts and enjoy catching and killing catnip mice—and real ones, too, if given access to the great outdoors, something that’s discouraged by breeders. Your indoor ASH will put presents on your pillow, usually well-killed catnip mice, and proudly wait for the well-deserved petting and praise.</p>

                    <li><h3>Bengal</h3></li>
                    <img src="htmimgs/bengal-cat.jpg"></img>
                    <p>the Bengal may look like a wild cat, but some say this breed is as lovably friendly as any domestic cat. Full of life and very people-oriented, Bengals are playful, gregarious, energetic cats with a generous dose of feline curiosity. Fans of the Bengal rave about their personality and playful antics. Bengals form strong bonds of love and loyalty with their families, and become faithful, affectionate, fun-loving friends, provided you meet them halfway and give them the love they need in return.

                        Athletic and agile, Bengals love to climb and will gravitate toward the highest point in any room. Bengals are often great sources of entertainment. One of the main characteristics that make them so special as companions is their intelligence. It’s not surprising Bengals are sharp as furry tacks since surviving in the jungle takes wit as well  lightning reflexes.
                        
                        Bengals learn very quickly, and enjoy learning new behaviors. In fact, they may learn tricks you’d rather they didn’t, such as turning on and off light switches, opening doors, and flushing toilets. The curious Bengal may get into everything, and changes in the home often provoke a quick response from the Bengal. Open a cupboard and your Bengal may dive in for a look-see, and will rearrange the contents if they’re not up to his standards.
                        
                        Because of the leopard cat’s habit of eliminating in water to hide their scent from larger predators, some Bengals learn to use the toilet. Like their wild relatives, Bengals relish their freedom; they dislike being held or restrained. This isn’t unique to Bengals but to most very active breeds. Bengals often love water, particularly if it’s running. Some only dip an occasional paw under the faucet, while others may try to go for a romp in the tub or shower—as long as it’s their idea. Some report that their cats’ fascination with water borders on obsession, and steps must be taken to keep floods to a minimum; Bengal owners quickly learn to keep the toilet lid down.</p>

                        <li><h3>sphynx</h3></li>
                        <img src="htmimgs/sphynx.jpg"></img>
                        <p>To say Sphynxes are lively is an understatement; they perform monkey-like aerialist feats from the top of doorways and bookshelves. Very devoted and loyal, they follow their humans around, wagging their tails doggy fashion, kneading with their padded toes, and purring with delight at the joy of being near their beloved humans. They demand your unconditional attention and are as mischievous (and lovable) as children. And despite all that and their alien appearance, they are still entirely cats, with all the mystery and charm that has fascinated humankind for thousands of years. While the Sphynx may not be for everyone, its unique appearance and charming temperament has won it an active, enthusiastic following.</p>

                        <li><h3>Persian</h3></li>
                        <img src="htmimgs/persian.jpeg"></img>
                        <p>If you want your cats bouncing around like hyperactive popcorn, don’t adopt a Persian. Persians are perfect companions, if you like placid, sweet-tempered cats. Don’t count on using your Persian pal as a furry doorstop, however. They love to play between periods of regal lounging on your favorite davenport. Proponents say that Persians do not deserve their furniture-with-fur reputation; they are intelligent, just not as inquisitive as some breeds, and not as active.

                            Persians are devoted to their humans, but can be selective in conferring that honor. You must earn their trust and love. They crave affection and love to be petted and fussed over, but won’t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They will, however, let their feelings be known if they are not getting the requisite amount of attention.
                            
                            Persians require significant time commitment. That beautiful coat requires daily grooming to keep it in good condition and free of mats. Many Persians require professional grooming.</p>

                            <li><h3>Bombay</h3></li>
                            <img src="htmimgs/bombay-cat.jpg"></img>
                            <p>If an aloof, independent cat is what you’re searching for, this breed isn’t for you. The Bombay is an endearing breed: playful, loving, lighthearted, and agreeable to just about any suggestion from their family, particularly if that includes an invigorating game of fetch or a cuddle on the couch.

                                Due to their hybrid heritage, Bombays strike a pleasing balance between the moderate American Shorthair and the frisky, vocal Burmese. However, since the American Shorthair is less prominent today, Bombays tend to be more like the Burmese than like the American Shorthair.
                                
                                They are very clever and people-oriented (thanks to the Burmese background), but won’t talk your ear off every second of the day (thanks to the American Shorthair). However, Bombays will get their thoughts across if they have something vital to impart, and you can count on them to stare you down with those hypnotizing copper eyes and repeat the message until you give them your full attention. They want quite a bit of attention, and they are clever in their attempts to gain your notice. When you sit down, don’t be surprised to see your Bombay sitting beside you moments later.
                                
                                Bombays are very attached to their families and tend to love the entire family rather than bond with one person. Some say they are particularly good with well-behaved children. Known for their curiosity and high intelligence, Bombays love to follow their human companions all over the house. They love to keep an eye on every move and help with every chore. This doesn’t get the chores done faster, but it’s certainly entertaining.</p>

                                <li><h3>Egyptian Mau</h3></li>
                                <img src="htmimgs/egyptian-mau.jpg"></img>
                                <p>While some people might at first be attracted to the Egyptian Mau’s beautiful spotted coat, most become fans due to the breed’s temperament and personality. Maus, like their ancestors that were invited along on the duck hunts of their Egyptian companions, love to fetch. In fact, they love any play activity that mimics hunting behavior. Indoor-only Maus, the only kind recommended by most enthusiasts, will sometimes leave gifts of well-killed catnip mice on the pillows of their favorite people. Be sure to give your Mau lots of pettings and praise, and perhaps a treat or two, for these presents; Maus will be upset, and quite confused, if their generous gifts are coldly rejected. While not overly talkative, Maus will let their humans know if something is amiss, particularly if that something concerns food dishes. Their voices are usually melodious and quiet. When engaged in conversation with their human companions, Maus wag their tails, tread with their feet, and make a variety of sounds that fanciers call “chortling.” Maus are devoted to the humans who pay them the proper homage. If you show your Mau you can be trusted, your Mau will shower you with love and loyalty. They are fiercely loyal cats who generally don’t take to strangers. Once they bond with their preferred persons, they want to be worshipped by their chosen family rather than by the entire human race.</p>
