            <li><h3>ALASKAN MALAMUTE</h3></li>
            <img src="images/alaskan malamute.jpg"></img>
            <p>The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.

                Novice owners, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself. An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced owner, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate. However, if you can meet this breed’s needs, you’ll have an intelligent, highly-trainable, loving companion for life.</p>

                <li><h3>BULLDOG</h3></li>
                <img src="images/bulldog.jpg"></img>
                <p>To be sure, English Bulldogs are among the cutest of the wrinkly puppies, but all that extra skin will be put to good use as the massive frame of this short, stocky, majestic little pup fills in. But for several short lapdog months you’ll have plenty of extra skin to rub between your fingertips as you sit on the couch and muse on your wonderful companion, marveling at the size of his mouth and the width of his head and wondering if you should insist on the original “Bolddogge” spelling when filling out his paperwork at the vet (go for it).The sweet, amiable, affectionate English Bulldog makes an excellent companion for children. Talk to your vet about feeding your new Bulldog pup who will need several feedings a day in the beginning and less as he or she grows up. Bulldogs tend to put on excess weight if their diet and nutrition is not managed properly so be sure to stay on top of that.

                    You’ll also want to make sure to keep lots of cool, fresh, clean water easily accessible since Bulldog pups tend to over heat faster than some other breeds. You’ll also want to check your pup’s ears regularly for discharge or smell since they can get infected and cause your puppy to be very uncomfortable.
                    
                    Bulldog puppies are full of sweetness and love, much of which overflows in the folds and wrinkles of the extra puppyhood skin.</p>

                    <li><h3>BEAGLE</h3></li>
                    <img src="images/beagle.jpg"></img>
                    <P>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.

                    Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States. But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.></P>

                    <p>The Corgi Inu is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the Shiba Inu and the Corgi dog breeds. With the adorable looks of a fox, these vigilant, affable pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.

                        Corgi Inus go by several names, including the Shiba Corgi or simply the Corgi Shiba Inu mix. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed-breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop</p>

                        <p>Best known as the star of Disney’s 101 Dalmatians, this sleek and athletic dog breed has a history that goes back several hundred years. He started out as a coach dog but has also served in many other capacities, including hunter, firehouse dog, and circus performer. As charming in life as in film, he goes from gallant to goofy to gallant again in the blink of an eye, and loves to be a part of everything his family does.</p>

                        <img src="images/german shepherd dog.jpg"></img>
                        <p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds—for good reason.

                        They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile, excelling at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and–last but not least–faithful companion.</p>

                        <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them fabulous family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.

                            <img src="images/great dane.jpg"></img>
                            <p>Oh, baby! A Great Dane is truly a great dog breed–large and noble, commonly referred to as a gentle giant or as the “Apollo of dogs.” Apollo is the Greek god of the sun, the brightest fixture in the sky.

                                Great Danes have been around for a long time, and depictions of Dane-like dogs on artifacts date back thousands of years. Although this is a pure breed of dog, you may find them in shelters and rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you decide this is the dog for you.Great Danes certainly hold stature in the dog world; but though they look terribly imposing, in reality they’re one of the best-natured dogs around. For all of their size, Great Danes are sweet, affectionate pets. They love to play and are gentle with children.

                                DogTime recommends this big, spacious crate to give your big Great Dane a place to rest and relax. You should also pick up this dog brush and massager for your short-haired pup!</p>

                                <p>The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen’s helpers: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.

                                    Today’s Lab is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors, and they’re also America’s most popular breed. Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.

                                    <p>Rottweilers were originally dogs bred to drive cattle to market. Later they were used to pull carts for butchers. They were among the earliest police dogs and serve with honor in the military.

                                        Most important, they are popular family guardians and friends.

                                        <p>Originally the Saint Bernard dog breed was used to guard the grounds of Switzerland’s Hospice Saint Bernard as well as to help find and save lost and injured travelers.

He is versatile and excels in the show ring and in obedience trials, drafting (pulling a cart or wagon), and weight pulling competitions.

                                            <P>The Siberian Husky is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia.

                                                It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a fenced yard that is sunk in the ground to prevent escapes.</P>

                                                <P>Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space. These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally bred to be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship.</P>
